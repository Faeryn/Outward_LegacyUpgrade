# Legacy Upgrade

## Features
Allows the player to form a Legacy Bond with an item, and eventually upgrade it to its legacy version (similar to vanilla legacy chest upgrade).  
The enchantment recipe can be bought from the Soroborean Caravanner.  
*Warning: The mod is beta/early access - there may be a major rebalancing before the final release.*

### Hints
If you get stuck, here are some hints (select to reveal):  
Stage 1:
<p style="color:black; background-color: black">The enchantment process only works around noon.</p>
Stage 2:
<p style="color:black; background-color: black">You have to put the item into a Legacy Chest to bond it.</p>
Stage 3:
<p style="color:black; background-color: black">You must do damage while wearing the Legacy Bond enchanted item.</p>
<p style="color:black; background-color: black">Any sort of damage works, even from spells.</p>
<p style="color:black; background-color: black">Damage is spread evenly between each item you have equipped, so if you have multiple items equipped, each of them will bond slower.</p>
<p style="color:black; background-color: black">A finished bond shows "Complete".</p>
Stage 4:
<p style="color:black; background-color: black">Once you completed the bond, put the item into a Legacy Chest again.</p>

## Planned features
- Consider making a new incense for the enchantment
- Enchantment should work only on items with legacy upgrades (not all of them)
