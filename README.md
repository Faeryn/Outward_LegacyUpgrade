# Legacy Upgrade

## Features
Allows the player to form a Legacy Bond with an item, and eventually upgrade it to its legacy version (similar to vanilla legacy chest upgrade).  
*Warning: The mod is beta/early access - there may be a major rebalancing before the final release.*

## Planned features:
- Consider making a new incense for the enchantment
- Enchantment should work only on items with legacy upgrades (not all of them)

## Special thanks
- **stormcancer** for the core idea of the mod
